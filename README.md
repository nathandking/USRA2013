B-Methods for partial differential equations with blow-up solutions. 

MATLAB code from NSERC USRA in summer of 2013. The codes within are implementation of some of the methods discussed in Melanie Beck's Thesis:

M. Beck, “B-methods: Special time–integrators for differential equations with blow-up solutions,” Ph.D. dissertation, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada, August 2009.

Adaptive: explores the adaptive time-stepping methods mentioned briefly in reference above. 

Fixed: explores fixed time-stepping methods developed in above reference.

922Project: Code and paper from APMA 922 class project at Simon Fraser University.
